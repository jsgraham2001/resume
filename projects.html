        <h4>Bear Simulation</h4>
        <p>
            The Bear Simulation demonstrates a virtual ecosystem of various critters 
            trying to survive the longest. Every creature or plant in the simulation is 
            placed on a visible grid consisting of land and water. The simulation selects 
            a thing at random and has it try and perform its various functions, which 
            typically consist of trying to breed, trying to eat, and then trying to move. 
            This process continues until either the life of the world ends, or either the 
            total number of bears or smart Bears reaches 0. These two bears are the star 
            of the show, with the regular bears choosing their movements randomly and the 
            smart bears basing their moves on the distant presence of potential food. The 
            simulation hopes to demonstrate the effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence 
            and has the potential to incorporate other concepts such as reinforcement 
            learning.
